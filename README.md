# ROV-Controller

This is the controller code for ROV. The ROV is controlled by an arduino and consists of the following components:
Thrusters
Robotic Arm
LEDs
Sensors
Camera

The controller is primarily responsible for controlling the thrusters and robotic arm. Along with that, the controller code also sends commands for any specific instructions. 
All communication with the ROV is done using TCP connection.
